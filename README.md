# DataCamp-Data-Analysis-in-Excel

## Course Objectives

In this course, we’ll develop employable data analyst skills, starting with the Excel basics, what it can do, and the data analysis steps we should follow.

The chapters begin by exploring data; navigate our worksheet and trim and classify our data types. We’ll even work with real-world Kickstarter data to use our new-found Excel skills to analyze what makes a successful project.

Later chapters in this course will teach us how to prepare our data by extracting text, preparing date data, and which Excel formulas can help. We’ll learn to use ‘the most important function in Excel’, VLOOKUP, to combine data from different sources before testing our understanding in hands-on exercises.

## Kickstarter Data Analysis

Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform where creators can gather interest on a project they'd like to launch. The general public, also called backers, can invest and send these projects into production. The dataset we have contains data on all projects in the games category hosted on Kickstarter in 2019.

We just heard that there is a new backer for a game called Iwari. This person is willing to invest $1000 in the project. This means the data needs to be updated. Both the backers count as the amount pledged need to be adjusted.
