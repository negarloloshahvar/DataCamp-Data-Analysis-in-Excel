# DataCamp-Data-Analysis-in-Excel

## Course Objectives

In this course, we’ll develop employable data analyst skills, starting with the Excel basics, what it can do, and the data analysis steps we should follow.

The chapters begin by exploring data; navigate our worksheet and trim and classify our data types. We’ll even work with real-world Kickstarter data to use our new-found Excel skills to analyze what makes a successful project.

Later chapters in this course will teach us how to prepare our data by extracting text, preparing date data, and which Excel formulas can help. We’ll learn to use ‘the most important function in Excel’, VLOOKUP, to combine data from different sources before testing our understanding in hands-on exercises.
